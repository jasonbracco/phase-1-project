# First 100 NBA Games Search
This program seeks to compare NBA players and their statistics through the first 100 games of their NBA careers

## Functionality
Provide a player name in the player search bar - if you do not know the full name, give the search a partial, and it will return everyone who matches.  To view their statistics in their first 100 games played, simply click on the desired player and their stats will appear.  Compare as many players as you would like.  When the list gets too long for you, simply hit the Delete key and all of the rendered statistics will disappear.
